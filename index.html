    <h2>Our friend Gear is an amazing person. He has always been there for us no matter the time of the day.
        Every night, he would always kiss us goodnight and watch Youtube videos at full volume until 3 a.m.
        This would annoy us so much that we would wake up every night to tell him to shut it. We don't feel that way now. 
        Everything's different when Gear got his diagnosis. Since then we realized that one day in the future, Gear might
        not be around to drive us crazy.

    <h3>Gear and his son</h3>
    <h2>Now we feel lucky when we wake up to his laughter or when his phone flashes at our faces. We even like to smell his farts now.
        It means he's still around.

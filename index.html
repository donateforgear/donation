    <h2>My friend Gear is an amazing person. He has always been there for me no matter the time of the day.
        Every night, he would always kiss me goodnight and watch Youtube videos at full volume until 3 a.m.
        This would annoy me so much that I wake up every night to tell him to shut it. I don't feel that way now. 
        Everything's different when Gear got his diagnosis. Since I realized that one day in the future, Gear might
        not be around to drive me crazy.

    <h3>Gear and his son</h3>
    <h2>Now I feel lucky when I wake up to his laughter or when his phone flashes at my face. I even like to smell his farts now.
        It means he's still around.
